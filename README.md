Project Completion Status Update
Hello,

Please note that this project is not 100% complete as originally scoped.

I started working on this project late after recently receiving the registration form today (or shortly after), which prevented me from completing all features within the given timeframe.

What Has Been Successfully Implemented:

✅ Core Character Fetching: Successfully fetching and displaying the initial list of characters.

✅ Search Functionality: Implemented working server-side search using the character name parameter.

✅ Routing and Details Page: Functional routing to the /details/:id page.

✅ Character Details: Successfully fetching and displaying all primary character information (Image, Status, Origin, Location).

✅ UI/Design: Built a consistent, dark-themed, and responsive user interface using Tailwind CSS.

Missing/Incomplete Feature:

❌ Batch Episode Fetching: The logic to collect all episode URLs for a character and make a single API call to fetch all episode details for the list is implemented but the final display/error handling might need polishing.

I hope the completed sections effectively demonstrate my proficiency in using React, TypeScript, Custom Hooks, Routing (React Router DOM), and API integration (Axios).

Thank you for your understanding.
